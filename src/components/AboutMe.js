          Thanks for stopping by! My name is CJ Norris, I am currently a UH-60M
          Blackhawk Helicopter Instructor Pilot for the Kentucky Army National
          Guard. I have begun a career pivot into the tech industry by attending
          the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp at LEARN Academy. I enjoy
          learning in an environment of mentorship and hands-on experience. I
          love working on complex problems and applying critical thinking
          skills.
